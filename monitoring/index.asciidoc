[[xpack-monitoring]]
= Monitoring the Elastic Stack

[partintro]
--
The {monitoring} components enable you to easily monitor the Elastic Stack
from {kibana-ref}/introduction.html[Kibana].
You can view health and performance data for {es}, Logstash, and
{kib} in real time, as well as analyze past performance.

When you install {xpack}, a monitoring agent runs on each {kib},
{kib}, and Logstash instance to collect and index metrics.

By default, metrics are indexed within the cluster you are monitoring.
Setting up a <<monitoring-cluster, dedicated monitoring cluster>> ensures
you can access historical monitoring data even if the cluster you're
monitoring goes down. It also enables you to monitor multiple clusters
from a central location.

When you use a dedicated monitoring cluster, the metrics collected by the
Logstash and {kib} monitoring agents are shipped to the {es}
cluster you're monitoring, which then forwards all of the metrics to
the monitoring cluster.
