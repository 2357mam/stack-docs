This section summarizes the changes in each release for all of the {xpack}
components: {security}, {monitoring}, {watcher}, {reporting}, {xpackml}, and
{graph}.

As a general rule, we strive to keep backwards compatibility between minor
versions, but there might be breaking changes between major versions. Breaking
changes are listed at the top of the release notes for each version.
