=== Upgrading {xpack}

You must upgrade all of the Elastic Stack products you are using when upgrading
to a new major version.

****
The steps you need to take to upgrade differ depending on which products you
are using. Want a list that's tailored to your stack? Try out our
{upgrade_guide}[Interactive Upgrade Guide].
****

IMPORTANT: If you use {security} and are upgrading directly to
{version} from 5.5 or earlier, you must upgrade the `.security` index
after you restart {es}. Native realm users will not be able to
authenticate until the index is upgraded. For instructions, see
{stack-ref}/upgrading-elastic-stack.html#upgrade-internal-indices[Upgrading
internal indices]. You also need to upgrade the `.security` index if
you restore a pre-5.6 snapshot to a fresh 6.0 install.

To upgrade {xpack}:

. Stop any {ml} jobs that are running before starting the upgrade process. See
<<stopping-ml>>.

. Stop {es}.

. Uninstall {xpack} from {es}:

IMPORTANT:  If you're upgrading a production cluster, perform a
            {ref}/rolling-upgrades.html[rolling upgrade] to ensure recovery is
            as quick as possible. Rolling upgrades are supported when upgrading
            to a new minor version. A full cluster restart is required when
            upgrading to a new major version.
