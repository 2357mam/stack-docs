== Breaking Changes

This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating
your application from one version to another.

As a general rule, we strive to keep backwards compatibility between minor
versions (for example, 5.x to 5.y), but there might be breaking changes between
major versions (for example, 5.x to 6.y).
