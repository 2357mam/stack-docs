== Get up and running

beta[]

To get up and running with infrastructure monitoring, you need:

* An Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana (version 6.5 or later) with a basic
license. To learn how to get up and running quickly, see
{stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html[Getting started with the
{stack}].

[TIP]
==============
You can skip having to install {es} and {kib} by using our
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[hosted {es} Service] on
Elastic Cloud. The {es} Service is available on both AWS and GCP.

=== Install {beats} shippers

To populate the {infra-ui} UI with metrics and log data, you need to install and
configure the following shippers:

* {metricbeat} for metrics
* {filebeat} for log data

To learn how to install and configure the shippers, do one of the following:

* Follow the instructions in the Add Data section of the {kib} home page.

** Click *Add log data* and follow the link for the logs you want to collect.

** Click *Add metrics* and follow the link for the metrics you want to collect.

* If your data source isn't in the list, or you want to install {beats} the old
fashioned way:

** Follow the 
{metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-getting-started.html[{metricbeat} getting started]
and enable modules for the metrics you want to collect.

** Follow the
{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-modules-quickstart.html[{filebeat} modules quick start]
and enable modules for the metrics you want to collect.

For either approach, you need to enable the following modules to populate the
{infra-ui} UI with data:

* {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-module-system.html[{metricbeat} `system` module]
* {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-system.html[{filebeat} `system` module]
* {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-module-docker.html[{metricbeat} `docker` module]
* {metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-module-kubernetes.html[{metricbeat} `kubernetes` module]

// REVIEWERS: Have I missed anything? Is there more detail required, or is it
// OK (for beta, at least) to direct users to the Add data tutorials and
// docs for install/config info? I'm concerned that the container monitoring
// info might be incomplete.
