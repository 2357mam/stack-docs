=== Installing {xpack}

To use {xpack} you need:

* {es} {version} - {ref}/_installation.html[Installing {es}]
* {Es} {version} -  {kibana-ref}/setup.html[Getting {kib} Up and Running]

You must run the version of {xpack} that matches the version of {es}
you are running.

{xpack} also provides a monitoring UI for {logstash-ref}/introduction.html[Logstash].

To install {xpack}:

. {ref}/installing-xpack-es.html[Install {xpack} on {es}]
. {kibana-ref}/installing-xpack-kb.html[Install {xpack} on {kib}]
. {logstash-ref}/installing-xpack-log.html[Install {xpack} on Logstash]

NOTE: The {xpack} installation scripts require direct internet access to
download and install {xpack}. If your servers donâ€™t have internet access, you
can manually download the {xpack} zip file and transfer it to a temporary
directory on the offline machines. The plugins for {es}, {kib} and Logstash are
all included in a single zip file. For more information about installing {xpack}
on offline machines, see the product-specific {xpack} installation instructions.
