=== Installing {xpack}

You must install {es} and {kib} before you install {xpack}. If you plan to use
the {xpack} features in Logstash, you must also install Logstash before you
install {xpack}. For more information, see:

* {ref}/install-elasticsearch.html[Installing {es}]
* {kibana-ref}/install.html[Installing {kib}]
* {logstash-ref}/installing-logstash.html[Installing Logstash]

You must install the version of {xpack} that matches the version of each product.
For more information about product compatibility, see the
https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_compatibility[Elastic Support Matrix].

NOTE: The {xpack} installation scripts require direct internet access to
download and install {xpack}. If your servers donâ€™t have internet access, you
can manually download the {xpack} zip file and transfer it to a temporary
directory on the offline machines. The plugins for {es}, {kib} and Logstash are
all included in a single zip file. For more information about installing {xpack}
on offline machines, see the product-specific {xpack} installation instructions.
