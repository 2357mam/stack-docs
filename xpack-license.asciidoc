When you initially install {xpack}, a 30 day license is generated that
allows access to {xpack} features. By default, this is a trial license that
allows access to all features -- the equivalent of a platinum license. If you
prefer, you can configure the cluster to generate a basic license at startup. If
you choose the basic license, you can later activate a trial license by using an
API. At the end of the 30 day period, you can
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions/[purchase a subscription]
to keep using the full functionality of the {xpack} components.

IMPORTANT:  When your license expires, {xpack} operates in a degraded mode. For
more information, see  <<license-expiration, License Expiration>>.

[[generated-license]]
== Generating a license

If a license is not already registered for the cluster, one is generated when
the nodes start. By default, this is a 30 day trial license that gives access to
all {xpack} features.

NOTE: You are allowed to initiate a trial license only if your cluster has not
already activated a trial license for the current major {xpack} version. For
example, if you have already activated a trial for v6.0, you cannot start a new
trial until v7.0.

If you do not want to immediately use your trial license, you can set the
`xpack.license.self_generated.type` to `basic` in your `elasticsearch.yml` file.
This setting generates a basic license instead of a trial license. In this case,
the self-generated license gives access only to the features of a standard basic
license.  For more information, see
{ref}/license-settings.html[{xpack} License Settings].

You can also use the `start_trial` API to start a trial license:

. Check if you are eligible to start a trial:
+
--
[source,shell]
-----------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET -u elastic:elastic_password 'http://<host>:<port>/_xpack/license/trial_status'
-----------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

--

. If you are eligible to start a trial:
+
--
[source,shell]
-----------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET -u elastic:elastic_password 'http://<host>:<port>/_xpack/license/start_trial'
-----------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE
--

When you use this API, the trial license replaces your existing license. If you
want to revert to your existing license when the trial is complete, you must
install your license again. If you do not already have a license, you must
https://register.elastic.co/[register for a new basic license].

[[installing-license]]
== Updating Your License

You can update your license at runtime without shutting down your nodes. License
updates take effect immediately. The license is provided as a _JSON_ file that
you install with the `license` API.

When security is enabled, you need `manage` cluster privileges to install the
license. The <<built-in-users,built-in `elastic` user>> has the required
privileges.

To update your license:

. Send a request to the `license` API and specify the file that contains your
new license:
+
--
[source,shell]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -XPUT -u elastic 'http://<host>:<port>/_xpack/license' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @license.json
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

Or on windows machine:

[source,shell]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
gc .\license.json |  Invoke-WebRequest -uri http://<host>:<port>/_xpack/license -Credential elastic -Method Put
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

Where:

* `elastic` is the built-in super user. If you haven't already,
<<built-in-users,set a password for this user>>.
* `<host>` is the hostname of the Elasticsearch node (`localhost` if executing
  locally)
* `<port>` is the http port (defaults to `9200`)
* `license.json` is the license JSON file

NOTE:  The `@` symbol before the license file in the `curl` command is important.
  This tells curl that the argument is a filename.

NOTE:  If your {es} node has SSL enabled on the HTTP interface, you must
  start your URL with `https://`

--

. If the license you are installing does not support all of the features
available with your previous license, you are notified in the response. To
complete the license installation, you must resubmit the license update request
and set the `acknowledge` parameter to `true` to indicate that you are aware of
the changes.
+
--
[source,shell]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -XPUT -u elastic 'http://<host>:<port>/_xpack/license?acknowledge=true' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @license.json
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE
--

[[listing-licenses]]
== Viewing the Installed License

You can also use the `license` API to retrieve the currently installed license:

[source,shell]
-----------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET -u elastic:changeme 'http://<host>:<port>/_xpack/license'
{
  "license" : {
    "status" : "active",
    "uid" : "0a98411f-73f4-4c67-954c-724874ed5488",
    "type" : "trial",
    "issue_date" : "2015-10-13T18:18:20.709Z",
    "issue_date_in_millis" : 1444760300709,
    "expiry_date" : "2015-11-12T18:18:20.709Z",
    "expiry_date_in_millis" : 1447352300709,
    "max_nodes" : 1000,
    "issued_to" : "elasticsearch",
    "issuer" : "elasticsearch"
  }
}
-----------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

NOTE: You need `monitor` cluster privileges to retrieve the license.
Users with `manage` cluster privileges can retrieve and install the license.

[[license-expiration]]
== License Expiration

Your {xpack} license is time based and expires at a future date. If you're
using {monitoring} and your license will expire within 30 days, a license
expiration warning is displayed prominently. Warnings are also displayed on
startup and written to the {es} log starting 30 days from the expiration date.
These error messages tell you when the license expires and what features will be
disabled if you fail to update the license.

[float]
=== Watcher
* PUT / GET watch APIs will be disabled, DELETE watch API will continue to work
* Watches will execute and write to the history
* The actions of the watches will not execute

[float]
=== Monitoring
* The agent will stop collecting cluster and indices metrics
* The agent will stop automatically cleaning indices older than `xpack.monitoring.history.duration`

[float]
=== Graph
* Graph explore APIs will be disabled

[float]
=== Reporting
* Reporting will no longer be available in {kib}
* Report generation urls will stop working
* Existing reports will no longer be accessible

[float]
=== Security
* Cluster health, cluster stats and indices stats operations will be blocked
* All data operations (read and write) will continue to work

Once the license expires, calls to the cluster health, cluster stats, and index
stats APIs fail with a `security_exception` and return a 403 HTTP status code.

[source,sh]
-----------------------------------------------------
{
  "error": {
    "root_cause": [
      {
        "type": "security_exception",
        "reason": "current license is non-compliant for [security]",
        "license.expired.feature": "security"
      }
    ],
    "type": "security_exception",
    "reason": "current license is non-compliant for [security]",
    "license.expired.feature": "security"
  },
  "status": 403
}
-----------------------------------------------------

This message enables automatic monitoring systems to easily detect the license
failure without immediately impacting other users.

[float]
=== Machine learning
* APIs to create jobs, open jobs, send data to jobs, create {dfeeds}, and start
{dfeeds} will be disabled
* All started {dfeeds} will be stopped. All open jobs will be closed
* Existing job results will continue to be available by using {kib} or APIs

[float]
=== Logstash Pipeline Management
* Will not be able to create new pipelines and edit or delete existing pipelines from the UI
* Will be able to list and view existing pipelines from the UI
* Will be able to run Logstash instances which are registered to listen to existing pipelines

IMPORTANT: You should update your license as soon as possible. You are
essentially flying blind when running with an expired license. Access to the
cluster health and stats APIs is critical for monitoring and managing an {es}
cluster.
