== Introduction
X-Pack is an Elastic Stack extension that bundles security, alerting, monitoring, reporting, and
graph capabilities into one easy-to-install package. While the X-Pack components are designed to work
together seamlessly, you can easily enable or disable the features you want to use.

Prior to Elasticsearch 5.0.0, you had to install separate Shield, Watcher, and Marvel plugins
to get the features that are bundled together in X-Pack. With X-Pack, you no longer have to
worry about whether or not you have the right version of each plugin, just install the X-Pack
for the Elasticsearch version you're running, and you're good to go!
